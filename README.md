#React Project

This is a project written entirely in React, using the create-react-app configuration.

I'd like the finished product to display a table that is sortable and editable by the user, supported by a database, and deployed on Heroku.

Right now, the code is based largely on the Excel component from _React Up & Running_ by Styoan Stefanov. The code is written in JSX. **Click** on headings to re-order columns alphabetically, **double-click** individual cells to edit. I'm planning on adding a router and styling, but the current bare bones version is online [here](https://shrouded-escarpment-12293.herokuapp.com/).

I'm using coffee data; all names, descriptions, and prices are taken from [Counter Culture Coffee](https://counterculturecoffee.com/).
