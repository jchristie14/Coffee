#React Project

This is a project written entirely in React, using the create-react-app configuration.

I'd like the finished product to display a table that is sortable and editable by the user, supported by a database, and deployed on Heroku.

I'm using coffee data; all names, descriptions, and prices are taken from [Counter Culture Coffee](https://counterculturecoffee.com/).
